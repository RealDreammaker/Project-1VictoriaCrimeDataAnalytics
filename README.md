Crime in Victoria

We were allocted four teams members to our project group.
Together we searched publically available data sets and choose recent "Victorian crime statistics" for data analysis.
Finalysing about 4 questions, we performed an initial analysis on this data using advanced excel techniques. 
We set about interrogating this data using python code in Jupyter Notebook. 
We utilised a number of modules including python, numpy, scipys, pandas, matplotlib and API's.
We created a repository on Github and utilised branches to write our own code. 
We then merged each branch code into the main repository.

Our main repository includes our program code, a PowerPoint Presentation and a write-up or presentation.
